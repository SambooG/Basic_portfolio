            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <p>I&apos;m Samantha, previously a Master stylist and educator. I have great attention to detail.  Creating things, whether with my hands or otherwise makes me happiest.  You can catch me at home rarely, as I&apos;m probably visiting any city or that I get the chance to.  One of the best ways to grow, in my opinion, is to see the world from a different perspective.  It gives you the chance to apply that practice to other situations.</p>     

            <p>Coming from the world of beauty is a paralelled and at the same time oddly similar environment to the coding world. I&apos;ve spent my career as a hair sylist as a sponge soaking up every bit of knowledge I could. From color, to extensions, to haircutting.  There was nothing like feeling that I crushed a new technique.  In the world of code there are so many different languages to learn.  Unlike hair, most of what I need is my computer, Google, and practice. in hair I need to pay for someones private time, new tools, travel, and something to practice on. The best similarity between the hair and programming worlds has to be the ability to create.</p>

            <p>When I&apos;m not working or traveling I enjoy spending time with my two dogs hiking in the woods, going to the shore with my fiance, and of course shopping. Cooking is another passion of mine I could never leave out. I love all kinds of food and am always looking for new dishes to make.</p>
