        <p>I&apos;m Samantha, veteran of the beauty world, previously Master stylist and educator. For better or worse, I'm obsessed with the way things look. Currentyly I'm enrolled in the Penn LPS bootcamp full stack program. 
        I'm looking forward to a new career creating something totally different than I have for the past 14 years.</p>

        <p>I've always loved learning new things and diving into new topics. I spend as much time as possible traveling. In my opinion it is one
        of the best ways to learn, and gives
        you the chance to see the world from a different perspective. </p>
